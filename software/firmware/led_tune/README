This firmware turns on the PWR, TC1 Pass and TC1 Fail LEDs so the resistor values can be tuned manually (by changing the resistor values).

This was done because the original chosen resistor values were too low and the LEDs were very bright.

There is no need to compile or run this unless we change the LEDs again or wish to make them brighter or dimmer.

I wasn't able to upload with the PIO upload button, but I was able to run program the board after downloading the (openwch/openocd_wch repo)[https://github.com/openwch/openocd_wch]. This repo provides a customised version of the openocd.exe util that works with the WHC-Link-E programmer and running the following command:

openocd_wch\bin\openocd.exe -f openocd_wch\bin\wch-riscv.cfg -c "program path\to\firmware.elf verify reset exit"
