Compile and upload with PlatformIO (this should automatically fetch the ch32fun framework) using a WCH-LinkE programmer.

Firmware based on design spec, BDD scenarios and simulator (test case) code.

If you have problems uploading via VSCode, try downloading the (openwch/openocd_wch repo)[https://github.com/openwch/openocd_wch]. This repo provides a customized version of the openocd.exe util that works with the WHC-Link-E programmer and running the following command:

openocd_wch\bin\openocd.exe -f openocd_wch\bin\wch-riscv.cfg -c "program path\to\firmware.elf verify reset exit"
