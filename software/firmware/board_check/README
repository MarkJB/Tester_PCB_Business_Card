This firmware lights up the LEDs one at a time (except for the PWR led which should be one all the time even though it is software controlled) so we can check the LEDs are functioning correctly.

It should also be extended to check the buttons work as expected.

I wasn't able to upload with the PIO upload button, but I was able to run program the board after downloading the (openwch/openocd_wch repo)[https://github.com/openwch/openocd_wch]. This repo provides a customised version of the openocd.exe util that works with the WHC-Link-E programmer and running the following command:

openocd_wch\bin\openocd.exe -f openocd_wch\bin\wch-riscv.cfg -c "program path\to\firmware.elf verify reset exit"
