# Tester PCB Business Card

A PCB Business Card designed for and by a Tester (QA Engineer)

I've always liked the PCB business cards I've seen people design. They always have an interesting story about the why and the how and sometimes even a job offer as a result!

I wanted to give it a go but couldn't think of anything compelling that was related to my primary industry (QA, Software Testing & Test Automation), but seeing a recent [pong example on Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2025/08/13/pcb-business-card-plays-pong-attracts-employer/) made me wonder if the author had done much testing which gave me the idea of creating a PCB business card that was all about testing.

So here is Rev A

This is based on the CH32V003F4U6. A 27Â¢ micro controller for which a one-wire programmer costs less than $8. I have no experience with this but cost was a big factor with the card. I'm aiming for sub $2 per unit so I can a) Afford to get a handful made and b) give them away at conferences and networking events.

Currently untested and no hardware in hand as yet.

I'm tempted to try an create a web based simulator as an experiment.
