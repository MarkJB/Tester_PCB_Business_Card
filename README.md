# Tester PCB Business Card

A PCB Business Card designed by a tester, for tester (QA Engineers)

I've always liked the PCB business cards I've seen people design. They often have an interesting story about the why and the how, and sometimes even lead to a job offer as a result!

I wanted to give it a go but couldn't think of anything compelling that was related to my primary industry (QA, Software Testing & Test Automation). Then I saw a recent [pong example on Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2025/08/13/pcb-business-card-plays-pong-attracts-employer/) which made me wonder whether the author had done much testing, and that sparked the idea of creating a PCB business card all about testing.

So here is Rev A:

This is based on the CH32V003F4U6. A 27Â¢ micro controller with a one-wire programmer that costs less than $8. I have no experience with this but cost was a big factor with the card. I'm aiming for sub $2 per unit so I can a) afford to get a handful made and b) give them away at conferences and networking events.

Currently untested and no hardware in hand as yet. The tests described in the silkscreen are subject to change based on feasibility and whether they are actually interesting or compelling to use.

I'm tempted to create a web-based simulator as an experiment.
